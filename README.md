# monte carlo streaming image
Its just a simple exercise for revisiting some previous concepts that i learned about http.

Its quite simple, its just streaming the image through http, generating some results using something similar to the montecarlo method and then nothing else.

Its simple, a good exercise, and nothing else.
For running it you can just play the command 
```sh
go run main.go
```
